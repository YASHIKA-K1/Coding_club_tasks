Hii I am Yashika Kumawat. I am currently a first year b-tech student in bioscience and bioengineering department. I am a beginner at coding but would love to learn and explore it. 
I would like to learn more about open-source as I am finding it interesting and would love to be a part of such a big community. It will be helpful in learning and sharing knowledge with people.
